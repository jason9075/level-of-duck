# Level of Duck

## Overview

The **Level of Duck Project** is an interactive 3D web application that demonstrates the Level of Detail (LOD) feature using a 3D model of a duck. Users can add multiple instances of the model, control rotation, and toggle LOD settings, all rendered in a Three.js scene.

### [Live Demo](https://jason9075.github.io/level-of-duck)

## Features

- **LOD Control**: Adjust the level of detail for the duck model to balance between rendering quality and performance.
- **Interactive Scene**: Rotate and manipulate the camera, change the number of duck instances, and adjust rotation on multiple axes.

## Technologies Used

- **Three.js**: A popular JavaScript library used for creating 3D graphics in the browser.
- **Stats.js**: To monitor FPS, memory, and rendering performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
